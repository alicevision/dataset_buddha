## The dataset
This dataset collects 67 images of a Buddha head placed on a table.
The images cover the whole object.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is composed of the following directories:

 - `buddha` contains the full dataset of 67 images;
 - `buddha_mini6` is a short version with only 6 selected images, usually used for quick testing.

For both dataset, and for each camera a file containing the estimated projection matrix is given, so that the MVS algorithm can be tested from this geometry.
